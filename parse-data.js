QUESTION:  What is the difference between AC and DC power systems?
ANSWER:  AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current) are two types of electrical power systems. In AC systems, the direction of current flow periodically reverses, typically 50 or 60 times per second. AC is used in most household and industrial applications due to its ability to be easily transformed to different voltage levels and transmitted over long distances efficiently. DC, on the other hand, maintains a constant direction of current flow. It's commonly used in batteries, solar panels, and many electronic devices. DC is advantageous for certain applications due to its steady voltage and current characteristics.

QUESTION:  How does a residual current device (RCD) contribute to electrical safety?
ANSWER:  A residual current device (RCD), also known as a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) in some regions, is a safety device that quickly breaks an electrical circuit to prevent serious harm from an ongoing electric shock. It works by continuously monitoring the balance of current between the live and neutral conductors. If it detects an imbalance, indicating that current is leaking to earth (possibly through a person), it rapidly disconnects the circuit, typically in less than 30 milliseconds. This speed of response can be life-saving, making RCDs crucial in preventing electrical injuries and electrocutions.
